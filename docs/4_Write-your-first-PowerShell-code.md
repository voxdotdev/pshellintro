After you've completed this module, you'll be able to:

   * Manage PowerShell inputs and outputs.
   * Diagnose errors when you type code incorrectly.
   * Identify PowerShell elements such as cmdlets, parameters, inputs, and outputs.

## Exercise - "Hello World"
One of the best ways to learn to code is to write many tiny programs. 

`New-Item` command creates a new .ps1 file in the directory the terminal is in. 

The `code` command followed by the file name will open the file in your default editor. This command is not unique to PowerShell. 

1. Confirm the directory you're in is your intended, if not, navigate there via [CD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/cd)
