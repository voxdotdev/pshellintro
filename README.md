# [Introduction to Powershell - Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/introduction-to-powershell/1-introduction)

This repository will cover a path to understanding PowerShell through various resources available, starting off with coursework avaiable through 
[Microsoft's Learn modules](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/browse/?terms=powershell&levels=beginner).

## Units

 1. [Introduction to PowerShell](docs/1_Introduction-to-PowerShell.md)

2. [Discover commands in PowerShell](docs/2_Discover-commands-in-PowerShell.md)

3. [Connect commands into a pipeline](docs/3_Connect-commands-into-a-pipeline.md)

4. [Write your first PowerShell code](docs/4_Write-your-first-PowerShell-code.md)

## [First Lesson - Introduction to PowerShell](/docs/1_Introduction-to-PowerShell.md) </br>

Units 1-4 are nearly word for word copies of the Microsoft courses and are mostly redundant. They exist to reinforce my own understanding.  

It is expected after Unit 4 further docs or projects added to this repo will be focused around personal interests via various resources.  

For the impatient, such as yours truly, looking to start scripting ASAP: </br>
* Read as much as you can tolerate in Units 1-3. 

* Take enough time to at least do the exercises, or practice any mentioned commands (ex. `Get-Process`), and how they chain (pipe) together. 
* Absorb Unit 4 in its entirety.  
* Feel free to reach out with any questions / suggestions / resources. Or if you're privy to github, submit a pull request.
