WHAT IS POWERSHELL? 

PowerShell is made up of two parts, a command-line shell and a scripting language.
PS is cross-platform. 

Command line shell: no graphical interface 
Typing text commands directly into a computer console
- Benefits: Faster than navigating through UI 
- Batch commands together in a script for automation
- Console interacts with cloud resources 
- Storing commands in a text file can be used as a source-control system
  - `git add .` , `git commit -m "iteration %num%"` 

Features of PowerShell shared with traditional shells:
- Built in help - also integrates with online help articles
- Pipeline - The output of one command is the input for the next command
- Aliases - alternate names that can be used to run commands 
-- such as cls (clear the screen) and ls (list the files

Features of PowerShell unique from traditional shells:
- It operates on objects over text
-- In command-line shell you have to run scripts where output and input might differ
-- In comparison, PowerShell uses objects as input and output, meaning less time formatting / extracting
